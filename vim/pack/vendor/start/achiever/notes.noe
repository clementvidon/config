There are 3 families of tasks:

- 'main' refers to the primary project. Ideally, there should be one main
  project (though multiple are allowed). It’s the project that should receive
  most of your focus.

  Ex. Your company.

- 'side' encompasses side work, such as side projects or any tasks that
  indirectly support your main project. It includes anything that isn’t
  categorized as 'main' or 'life.'

  Ex. A language you are learning, a topic you are studying, a side project you
  are building, a tool configuration you are refining.

- 'life' includes all essential life-related tasks life family, friends,
  health, finances.
